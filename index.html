      I was a student at the <strong>University of Seychelles</strong> studying for my diploma in Computing and IT.
      I have developed a passion for IT when i was introduced to my first computer at the age of 9. Ever since then I have never gone more than a
      few hours without one. I love researching and building on PC. But my true passion is data entry, lead generation and basically anything to
      with finding information. I am currently in the process of learning <strong>Web development</strong> and I will be more than happy to say that i'm excited to see where\
      it takes me.
      <br/>
      I'm also very interested in <strong>psychology</strong> and people. I love learning and listening to people. I would say that the main thing is the idea of manipulation
      but realisticly I love learning and observing people and finding out what makes them tick, just dont ask me to go talk to one beacuse I am extremely shy
      and insecure. (Glad no one is ever gonna see this tbh)
      I am kind, hardworking, devoted, and able to handle any situation I am placed in,
      I can also assess a problem and find the best possible solution as well as manage work under pressure, and I can work in group setting as well as alone.
